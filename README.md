# UFOs
Module 11
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to update Dana’s webpage we made during the module to include a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings. She wanted to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. She can now filter by date, city, state, country, and shape! 

## Results
Dana could use her webpage to filter based on any filter. She could filter on state and date, and it would only pull up the entities that have the state and date in them. 

## Summary
A drawback of this new design is Dana could forget she has a filter typed in and try to filter on one thing but it pulls up two. I would recommend adding a filter button to push instead of the server auto populating. I would also recommend including a drop down bar to see available states, shapes, etc. This way Dana doesn’t go in and try to find UFO data from Houston.
